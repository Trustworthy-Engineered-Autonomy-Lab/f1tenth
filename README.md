Autonomous RC Cars: F1Tenth Subsection

Trustworthy Engineered Autonomy Lab
University of Florida

Welcome to the repository for the Autonomous RC Cars project, developed as part of the F1Tenth subsection of the Trustworthy Engineered Autonomy Lab (TEA) at the University of Florida. In this project, we explore the integration of cutting-edge robotics, machine learning, and autonomous control systems to create robust, safe, and efficient autonomous systems for small-scale vehicles, specifically focusing on RC (radio-controlled) cars.
